# -RambergOsgoodSteel-Material-ABAQUS-plugin-
This plug-in implements the Ramberg–Osgood model to describe nonlinear stress–strain behavior near yielding. It captures smooth elastic–plastic transition and strain hardening in metals, with user-defined parameters that can be calibrated against experimental data for accurate nonlinear analysis.
